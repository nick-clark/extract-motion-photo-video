# File Type Testing

Please test and report back on your phone:

## When you extracted the motion photo:
1. **Before sharing to CapCut**, were you able to save the extracted video file to your phone's storage?
2. Try this: After extraction but before the share dialog appears, take a screenshot
3. Share the file to a different app (like Samsung Gallery or Google Drive) - does that work?
4. Try opening the extracted video in Samsung's video player before importing to CapCut

## Check the file in Gallery:
1. If the file was saved, go to your Gallery > Videos
2. Does the file appear there?
3. What does it show when you open it?
4. What's the file extension (.mp4, .mov, etc.)?

This will help diagnose if:
- The MIME type is the issue
- The file extraction is incomplete
- CapCut has specific requirements
