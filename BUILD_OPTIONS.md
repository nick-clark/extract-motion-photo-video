# Alternative Ways to Build APK (Without Android Studio)

## Option 1: GitHub Actions ⭐ EASIEST
- Push to GitHub → Automatic build → Download APK
- See `BUILD_WITH_GITHUB.md` for detailed instructions
- **Time:** 5 minutes to set up, 3 minutes per build
- **Cost:** Free

## Option 2: Gitpod (Cloud IDE)
1. Go to https://gitpod.io
2. Create account (free with GitHub)
3. Push your code to GitHub first
4. Visit: `https://gitpod.io/#YOUR_GITHUB_REPO`
5. In terminal: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
6. Download APK from workspace
- **Time:** 5 minutes
- **Cost:** Free (limited hours)

## Option 3: Install Android Command Line Tools Only
More lightweight than full Android Studio:

```bash
# Download command line tools from Google
# Extract and install SDK
# Then you can build with ./gradlew
```

**Pros:** Lighter than Android Studio
**Cons:** Still need to install ~1GB of tools

## Option 4: Use Someone Else's Computer
- If friend/colleague has Android Studio
- Give them this project folder
- They can build APK in 2 minutes
- Send you the APK file

## Option 5: Docker with Android SDK
If you have Docker installed:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/project -w /project android-builder ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

You'd need to find/create an Android Docker image.

## Option 6: Online Build Services
- **Bitrise:** Free tier available, might work
- **CircleCI:** Similar to GitHub Actions
- **Appetize.io:** Not for building, just for testing

## Option 7: Ask AI to Build It
- Some services like Replit.com can build Android apps
- Upload your project
- Run build command
- Download APK

## Recommendation

**For you:** Use **Option 1 (GitHub Actions)** - it's the simplest and most reliable.

Just needs:
1. GitHub account
2. Internet connection
3. 5 minutes

No software installation, no downloads, no environment setup.
